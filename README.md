# Hey there! 👋

I'm Héctor, a Web Front-end Developer :wrench: from Perú.

I like to create detailed and minimalist websites making the designs to come
alive, always improving every time I learn something new. :star2:

My tech stack:

![React][react]
![Astro][astro]
![TypeScript][typescript]
![JavaScript][javascript]
![CSS][css]
![SASS][sass]

I like to use the most agnostic features as possible, the most aligned
with the standards and the most supported by the browsers or I just let the
bundler to handle it for me. :white_check_mark:

My favorite project is [guess-the-word][guess-the-word], a simple game (or not?)
where I implemented a lot of things that I learned along the way. :pencil2:

Things I'm working on:

- [dev-challenges](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/dev-challenges)
- [nvim-config](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/nvim-config)
- [hrc](https://hdoc1509.github.io/hrc)
- [tree-sitter-hygen-template](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/tree-sitter-hygen-template)

Have a good day! n_n/

Other things about me:

- My favorite number is 15.
- My mind is almost always thinking about new things that I can learn, improve
  and implement. I'm perfectionist, that's it. :muscle:
- I absolutely enjoy using Neovim (the CLI, of course), it's the most
  customizable and powerful editor that I've ever used. :tada:
- I'm a guitarist. I really like music, play the songs that I like and
  bring to life the sounds I imagine in my mind. I have created a few songs,
  my treasures. :sparkles:
- My favorite colors are black and purple.
