# Hey there! 👋

I'm Héctor, also known as <i>Hdoc</i>, a Web Front-end Developer :wrench: from
Perú.

I like to create detailed and minimalistic websites making its designs to come
alive, always improving every time I learn something new. :star2:

My tech stack:

![React][react]
![Astro][astro]
![TypeScript][typescript]
![JavaScript][javascript]
![CSS][css]
![SASS][sass]

I like to use the most agnostic features as possible, the most aligned
with the standards and the most supported by the browsers. :white_check_mark:

My favorite project is [guess-the-word][guess-the-word], a simple game (or not?)
where I implemented a lot of things that I learned along the way. :pencil2:

I develop (or get new ideas to develop) every day. Be sure to check the
things I'm working on:

- [dev-challenges](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/dev-challenges)
- [nvim-config](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/nvim-config)
- [tree-sitter-hygen-template](https://github.com/Hdoc1509/tree-sitter-hygen-template)

Have a good day! n_n/

Other things about me:

- My mind is almost always thinking about new things that I can learn, improve
  and implement. I'm perfectionist, that's it. :muscle:
- I absolutely enjoy using Neovim (the CLI, of course), it's the most
  customizable and powerful editor that I've ever used. :tada:
- I'm a guitarist, I really like music, play the songs that I like and
  composing. I only created a few songs, my treasures. :sparkles:
